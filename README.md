# Oxford 3000 Word List

A simple - relatively - small dictionary of words. I created this since there was a lack of accessible dictionary lists out on the internet. So I decided to create one to help future developers working with words/dictionaries.

I uploaded two different .txt files. One is a basic file with all the words including spaces (Ex: I am). The second file replaces all spaces within the same phrase with an underscore (Ex: I_am). The second file still contains spaces between words and phrases.
